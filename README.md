# Blender Keymap for toggling 'Emulate 3 Button Mouse'

Script by [Robert Guetzkow](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/155523)

Install the [emulate.py](https://github.com/Raais/e3bm/blob/main/emulate.py) file as you would normally install an add-on, and enable it.

After installation, go to Preferences > Keymap > Window, and Add New at the bottom. Expand the new keybind and paste the following as the value of identifier:

`preferences.toggle_emulate_3_button_mouse`

Set the keybind to anything you want.
